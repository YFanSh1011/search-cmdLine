# search-cmdLine

"search" is a selenium-based command line tool that helps users search for information with designated or predefined browsers and search engines. 

Since the automation is based on selenium, the correct version of either Chrome or Firefox needs to be installed on your computer in order to use the command line tool.

# Initiation
To use command line tool "search", you need to first add the current download directory in PATH as well as creating an alias in your ".bash_profile". 

This could be achieved easily by executing the existing python script "init.py".

```bash
python3 init.py
```

"init.py" will add the current working directory as "$Current_Path" variable to the "search.sh" file, which will be used for further execution. 

It will also add an alias to the configured "search.sh" script so that "search" will be considered as a valid command in the next bash session.
